There are a few different types of treatment that can ease your symptoms and help keep your eyes healthy.</p> <p> <strong> Over-the-counter eye drops. </strong> The most common treatment for mild dry eye is a type of eye drops called artificial tears. You can get these eye drops without a prescription. There are also over-the-counter moisturizing gels and ointments that may help your eyes feel better.</p> <p> <strong> Prescription medicines. </strong> If your dry eye is more serious, your eye doctor may give you a prescription for medicines called cyclosporine (Restasis) or lifitegrast (Xiidra). These medicines are both types of eye drops that can help your eyes make more tears.</p> <p> <strong> Lifestyle changes. </strong> If something in your life or your environment is causing your dry eye, or making it worse, your doctor may suggest changes to help protect your eyes.</p> <p> For example, if a medicine you take for another health condition is causing dry eye, your doctor may also suggest that you try a different medicine.</p> <p> Your eyes may also feel better if you:</p> Try to avoid smoke, wind, and air conditioning Use a humidifier to keep the air in your home from getting too dry Limit screen time and take breaks from staring at screens Wear wraparound sunglasses when you're outside Drink plenty of water — try for 8 to 10 glasses every day Get enough sleep — about 7 to 8 hours a night <p> <strong> Tear duct plugs</strong> . If tears are draining too quickly from your eyes, your doctor may suggest putting special plugs (called punctal plugs) in your tear ducts (small holes in the inner corners of your eyes). These plugs can help keep your tears in your eyes.</p> <p> <strong> Surgery. </strong> In some cases, dry eye can happen because your lower eyelids are too loose, causing tears to drain too quickly out of your eye. If this is the cause of your dry eye, your eye doctor may suggest surgery to fix your eyelids and and help your tears stay on your eyes. This treatment is not very common.</p> <p> Talk over your options with your doctor. If another health condition is causing your dry eye, treating that condition may improve your dry eye symptoms. Even if you have dry eye, there are lots of things you can do to help keep your eyes healthy. Remember these tips:</p> Follow your doctor's instructions for using your eye drops (over-the-counter or prescription) Tell your doctor if dry eye is getting in the way of everyday activities <h2> Dry Eye Resources </h2> Watch this video about dry eye Get flyers, booklets, and other resources to print or download <strong> Last updated:</strong> July 5, 2019 <h2> Research News</h2> <p> Antibody-based eye drops show promise for treating dry eye disease <span> October 11, 2019</span> </p> <p> Penn Engineering’s blinking eye-on-a-chip used for disease modeling and drug testing <span> August 7, 2019</span> </p> <p> New Treatment for Severe Dry Eye Disease Promising in Early Clinical Trials <span> May 7, 2019</span> </p> Read more Dry Eye news <span> National Eye Institute</span> Facebook Twitter LinkedIn YouTube <p> </p> <h2> Contact NEI</h2> Contact Us Visit NIH Get Email Updates from NEI <h2> Policies</h2> Accessibility Information in Other Languages Privacy Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Disclaimers Web Policies <h2> For NEI Employees</h2> Intranet Emergency Information NIH Staff Directory NIH.gov HHS.gov USA.gov
